This COVID-19 Symptoms Checker dataset is from the Kaggle Repository and is based on the guidelines given by the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India. 

The dataset helps identify whether any person has coronavirus based on pre-defined standard symptoms. For this repo, I have chosen a more suitable dataset for Bayesian networks, that would pertain to the analysis of causation between symptoms, age, and other factors that would show if for example a person has a certain symptom, are they more susceptible to be old, or have another symptom, or the severity of the disease based on factors. None_Sympton and None_Experiencing points to a patient having no top 5 symptoms and not experiencing any other symptoms respectively. 

For this analysis, the symptom variables used would be Fever, Tiredness, Dry.Cough, Difficulty.in.Breathing, and Sore.Throat, which are the top 5 symptoms of COVID-19 as specified by the WHO. Other symptoms that are used would be the Pains, Nasal.Congestion, Runny.Nose, and Diarrhea. Variables for age help us identify if the virus is truly severe to those who are older. Three genders are used: Male, Female, and Transgender. The severity for the virus is considered to be None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. The contact tell us if the person has been in contact with someone with the virus. The country variable tells us which country the person visited, but for the purpose of this analysis, it will not be used.
